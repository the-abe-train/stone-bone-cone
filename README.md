# Stone, Bone, Cone

It's just like rock, paper, scissors, but with a pre-historic theme (and also it
rhymes). This project was created for the Deno KV Hackathon and was submitted on
June 15, 2023.

The purpose of this game is to showcase the new Deno KV database by creating a
massively-multiplayer rock-paper-scissors tournament on top of it. Check it out
