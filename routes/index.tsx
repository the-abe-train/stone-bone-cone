          Every 12 hours, all the cavepeople get together and have a battle
          royale!
        </p>
        <p>
          Before every battle, you must equip your cave person with their
          weapons of choice: a rock, a bone, and a cone. Rock (slow and heavy)
          beats bone, bone (agile and long) beats shell, shell (swift and sharp)
          beats rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          The battle will be a tournament, and your cave person will rotate
          between the 3 weapons in the order you provide for them. After going
          through all 6 pre-selected weapons, the order will repeat.
        </p>
